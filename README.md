## Servz ##

Servz is a Java library which facilitates writing long-lived binaries, such as servers or daemons, in a modular way.

Each bit of logic is implemented as a Servz module and the final binary is created by assembling the modules into a Servz server. In addition to providing the skeleton for running the binaries, the Servz libary also comes with a set of modules used for common logic, such as starting an http server.

## Requirements ##

Servz is built using Bazel. As such, the only dependencies required to build are:

* Bazel
* Java runtime

Bazel takes care of pulling down the Java libraries which Servz depends on, such as:

* Dagger
* Guava
* Netty
* Testing libraries such as JUnit, Mockito, Truth.

## Getting started ##

One of the example servers can be run by executing:

```
> bazel run src/main/java/org/servz/examples/requestscope:main
```

All tests can be run by executing:

```
> bazel test src/...
```
